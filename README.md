## Overview  
<hr>

There is not much to this script except that I was looking at analyzing some text documents and was practicing using `regular expressions` and extracting the data into different data structures.    

**`Note`**:  I did not pursue this in length because I do not regularly utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) in my current project loads; although, I do find some applications interesting like analyzing social media and comments section responses and news media transcripts.  I have one personal project in the queue to analyze MSNBC, FOX, and CNN transcripts over different time periods and scales to see the patterns and trends.
